Persona numer 2 (expact full degree/long term)

Name: Ruben
Age: 26
Nationality: Portuguese

Ruben just started studying and working part-time in copenhagen. He is and outgoing person that loves to spend time with his friends and colleagues, therefore he is always keen on looking for new places and events around to go to. He enjoys going to go to concerts once in a while but also likes to have quiet evening with friends over a couple of beverages.

He arrived in Copenhagen not so long ago so he is still not sure of the best locations for hanging out and meeting new people. Therefore he usually searches on facebook for cafés and bars around the city to go to or generally hears about them from a colleague or a friend at school or work. He enjoys a little competitive activity such as games, and mixing that with food and drinks is a perfect night out for him.
